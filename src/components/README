# Components Documentation

This directory contains all the reusable React components for the Furriyadh application.

## Structure

-   `/layout`: Contains components responsible for the overall page structure (e.g., Header, Footer, Sidebar).
-   `/ui`: Contains generic, reusable UI elements (e.g., Button, Card, Input, Table, Chart) styled with Tailwind CSS, often inspired by shadcn/ui patterns for composability and customization.

## Usage

Each component is designed to be imported and used directly in pages or other components.

```tsx
// Example: Using the Button component
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/Button"; // Assuming alias setup
// or
import { Button } from "../components/ui/Button";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Button variant="destructive" size="sm" onClick={() => alert("Clicked!")}>
      Delete
    </Button>
  );
}
